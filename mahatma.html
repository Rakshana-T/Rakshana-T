            <h2>Early Life</h2>
            <p>Mahatma Gandhi, born on October 2, 1869, in Porbandar, India, was a prominent leader of the Indian
                independence movement against British rule. He studied law in England and later moved to South Africa,
                where he became involved in the civil rights struggle.</p>

            <h2>Independence Movement</h2>
            <p>Gandhi returned to India in 1915 and became a leader in the Indian National Congress. He advocated for
                nonviolent civil disobedience as a means to achieve independence from British rule. His campaigns and
                protests, such as the Salt March, played a crucial role in India's struggle for freedom.</p>
